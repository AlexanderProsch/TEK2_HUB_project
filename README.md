# TEK2_HUB_project

This is the Hub Project that JohannesTimmreck(https://github.com/JohannesTimmreck) and i worked on during our second year at Epitech.

It is a small reinterpretation of the myrpg project we did in our first year. But this time we used the unity engine instead of the csfml library.
